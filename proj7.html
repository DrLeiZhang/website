<p><B>Abstract:</B></p>
<p>Facial beauty analysis has been an emerging subject of multimedia and biometrics. This paper aims at exploring the essence of facial beauty from the viewpoint of geometric characteristic toward an interac- tive attractiveness assessment (IAA) application. As a result, a geometric facial beauty analysis method is proposed from the perspective of machine learning. Due to the troublesome and subjective beauty la- beling, the accurately labeled data scarcity is caused, and result in very few labeled data. Additionally, facial beauty is related to several typical features such as texture, color, etc., which, however, can be eas- ily deformed by make-up . For addressing these issues, a semi-supervised facial beauty analysis framework that is characterized by feeding geometric feature into the intelligent attractiveness assessment system is proposed. For experimental study, we have established a geometric facial beauty (GFB) dataset including Asian male and female faces. Moreover, an existing multi-modal beauty (M 2 B) database including west- ern and eastern female faces is also tested. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Some new perspectives on the essence of beauty and the topic of facial aesthetic are revealed. The impact of this work lies in that it will attract more researchers in related areas for beauty exploration by using intelligent algorithms. Also, the significance lies in that it should well promote the diversity of expert and intelligent systems in addressing such challenging facial aesthetic perception and rating issue. </p>
