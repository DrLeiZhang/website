<p><B>Abstract:</B></p>
<p>In this paper, we propose an odor recognition
framework for multiple electronic noses (E-noses), machine
olfaction odor perception systems. Straight to the point, the
proposed transferring odor recognition model is called crossdomain
discriminative subspace learning (CDSL). General odor
recognition problems with E-nose are single domain oriented,
that is, recognition algorithms are often modeled and tested
on the same one domain data set (i.e., from only one
E-nose system). Different from that, we focus on a more realistic
scenario: the recognition model is trained on a prepared source
domain data set from a master E-nose system A, but tested on
another target domain data set from a slave system B or C
with the same type of the master system A. The internal
device parameter variance between master and slave systems
often results in data distribution discrepancy between source
domain and target domain, such that single-domain-based odor
recognition model may not be adapted to another domain.
Therefore, we propose domain-adaptation-based odor recognition
for addressing the realistic recognition scenario across systems.
Specifically, the proposed CDSL method consists of three merits:
1) an intraclass scatter minimization- and an interclass scatter
maximization-based discriminative subspace learning is solved on
source domain; 2) a data fidelity and preservation constraint of
the subspace is imposed on target domain without distortion; and
3) a minipatch feature weighted domain distance is minimized for
closely connecting the source and target domains. Experiments
and comparisons on odor recognition tasks in multiple E-noses
demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.</p>

<p><B>Approach:</B></p>
<p>Schematic of the proposed CDSL method; after a subspace projection
P, the source domain and target domain of different space distributions lie
in a latent subspace with good distribution consistency (the centers of both
domains become very close, and drift is removed); in this latent subspace,
the classification of two classes is successfully achieved. Formally, the top
coordinate system denotes the raw data points of source domain and target
domain in 3-D. We use the word “center” to represent the mean of the features.
From the top figure, we can see that the difference between the mean of source
domain and the mean of target domain is large in each dimension.</p>
