<h1>[Domain Adaptation for Drift Compensation in E-Nose]</a></h1>

<p>Lei Zhang* and David Zhang, Domain Adaptation Extreme Learning Machines for Drift Compensation in E-Nose Systems, IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement, vol. 64, no. 7, pp. 1790-1801, 2015. <a href="resources/DAELM.pdf">[paper]</a></p>

<p><B>Abstract:</B></p>
<p>This paper addresses an important issue known as
sensor drift, which exhibits a nonlinear dynamic property in
electronic nose (E-nose), from the viewpoint of machine learning.
Traditional methods for drift compensation are laborious and
costly owing to the frequent acquisition and labeling process for
gas samples’ recalibration. Extreme learning machines (ELMs)
have been confirmed to be efficient and effective learning
techniques for pattern recognition and regression. However,
ELMs primarily focus on the supervised, semisupervised, and
unsupervised learning problems in single domain (i.e., source
domain). To our best knowledge, ELM with cross-domain learning
capability has never been studied. This paper proposes a
unified framework called domain adaptation extreme learning
machine (DAELM), which learns a robust classifier by leveraging
a limited number of labeled data from target domain for drift
compensation as well as gas recognition in E-nose systems,
without losing the computational efficiency and learning ability of
traditional ELM. In the unified framework, two algorithms called
source DAELM (DAELM-S) and target DAELM (DAELM-T) are
proposed in this paper. In order to perceive the differences among
ELM, DAELM-S, and DAELM-T, two remarks are provided.
Experiments on the popular sensor drift data with multiple
batches collected using E-nose system clearly demonstrate that
the proposed DAELM significantly outperforms existing driftcompensation
methods without cumbersome measures, and also
bring new perspectives for ELM.</p>
