<p><B>Abstract:</B></p>
<p>Kinship verification in the wild is a challenging yet interesting
issue, which aims to determine whether two unconstrained
facial images are from the same family or not.
Most previous methods for kinship verification can be divided
as low-level hand-crafted features based shallow methods
and kin data only trained convolutional neural network
(CNN) based deep methods. Worthy of affirmation, numerous
work in vision get that convolutional features are discriminative,
but bigger data dependent. A fact is that for
a variety of data-limited vision problems, such as limited
Kinship datasets, the ability of CNNs is seriously dropped
because of overfitting. To this end, by inheriting the success
of deep mining algorithms on face verification (e.g. LFW),
in this paper, we propose a Coarse-to-Fine Transfer (CFT)
based deep kinship verification framework. As the idea implied,
this paper tries to answer “is it possible to transfer a
face recognition net to kinship verification?”. Therefore, a
supervised coarse pre-training and domain-specific ad hoc
fine re-training paradigm is exploited, with which the kinrelation
specific features are effectively captured from faces.
Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our proposed CFT adaptation approach is comparable
to the state-of-the art methods with a large margin.   </p>

<p>Intuitive illustration of NRML proposed by Lu Jiwen et al. (a) High-dimensional
feature space. The data points in blue and red denote parents and
children, respectively. The data points with kinship relation are
denoted as circles. The data points in the neighborhood and nonneighborhood
are denoted as triangles and squares, respectively.

<p><B>Experiments:</B></p>
<p>In experiments, two kinds of databases are considered:
large-scale CASIA WebFace data (500K) and small-scale
KinFace data (4K). The KinFace data include four publicly
available datasets, such as KinFaceW-I, KinFaceW-II,
Cornell KinFace and UB KinFace.</p>
