<p><B>Abstract:</B></p>
<p>In this paper, we aim at presenting the new challenges
of electronic noses (E-noses) and proposing effective
methods for handling the new challenging scientific issues to be
solved, such as signal discreteness (reproducibility), systematical
drift and nontarget disturbances. We first review the progress
of E-noses in applications, systems, and algorithms during the
past two decades. Recall a number of significant achievements
and motivated by the current issues that hinder large-scale
application pace of E-nose technology, we propose to address
three key issues: 1) discreteness; 2) drift; and 3) disturbance
(simplified as 3D issues), which are sensor induced and sensor
specific. For each issue, a highly effective and efficient method is
proposed. Specifically, for discreteness issue, a global affine transformation
method is introduced for E-nose instruments batch
calibration; for drift issue, an unsupervised feature adaptation
model is proposed to achieve effective drift adaptation; additionally,
for disturbance issue, we proposed a simple targets-to-targets
self-representation classifier method for fast nontargets detection,
without knowing any prior knowledge of thousands of nontarget
disturbances in real world. For each method, a closed form
solution can be analytically determined and the simplicity is guaranteed.
Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency
of the proposed methods for addressing the proposed 3D issues
in real applications of E-noses.</p>
