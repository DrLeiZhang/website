<p><B>Abstract:</B></p>
<p>We propose a novel reconstruction-based transfer
learning method called latent sparse domain transfer (LSDT)
for domain adaptation and visual categorization of heterogeneous
data. For handling cross-domain distribution mismatch,
we advocate reconstructing the target domain data with the
combined source and target domain data points based on
L1-norm sparse coding. Furthermore, we propose a joint learning
model for simultaneous optimization of the sparse coding and
the optimal subspace representation. In addition, we generalize
the proposed LSDT model into a kernel-based linear/nonlinear
basis transformation learning framework for tackling nonlinear
subspace shifts in reproduced kernel Hilbert space. The
proposed methods have three advantages: 1) the latent space
and the reconstruction are jointly learned for pursuit of an
optimal subspace transfer; 2) with the theory of sparse subspace
clustering, a few valuable source and target data points are
formulated to reconstruct the target data with noise (outliers)
from source domain removed during domain adaptation, such
that the robustness is guaranteed; and 3) a nonlinear projection
of some latent space with kernel is easily generalized for dealing
with highly nonlinear domain shift (e.g., face poses). Extensive
experiments on several benchmark vision data sets demonstrate
that the proposed approaches outperform other state-of-the-art
representation-based domain adaptation methods.   </p>
