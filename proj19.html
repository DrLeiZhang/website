<p><B>Abstract:</B></p>
<p>The electronic nose (E-nose), as a metal oxide
semiconductor gas sensor system coupled with pattern recognition
algorithms, is developed for approximating artificial olfaction
functions. Ideal gas sensors should be with selectivity, reliability,
and cross-sensitivity to different odors. However, a new problem
is that abnormal odors (e.g., perfume, alcohol, etc.) would show
strong sensor response, such that they deteriorate the usual usage
of E-nose for target odor analysis. An intuitive idea is to recognize
abnormal odors and remove them online. A known truth is
that the kinds of abnormal odors are countless in real-world scenarios.
Therefore, general pattern classification algorithms lose
effect because it is expensive and unrealistic to obtain all kinds
of abnormal odors data. In this paper, we propose two simple
yet effective methods for abnormal odor (outlier) detection:
1) a self-expression model (SEM) with l1/l2-norm regularizer is
proposed, which is trained on target odor data for coding and
then a very few abnormal odor data is used as prior knowledge
for threshold learning and 2) inspired by self-expression mechanism,
an extreme learning machine (ELM) based self-expression
(SE2LM) is proposed, which inherits the advantages of ELM
in solving a single hidden layer feed-forward neural network.
Experiments on several datasets by an E-nose system fabricated
in our laboratory prove that the proposed SEM and SE2LM
methods are significantly effective for real-time abnormal odor
detection.</p>

<p>Network structure of SE2LM. The difference between this structure
and ELM lies in that the number of input nodes is associated with the
dimensionality. In SE2LM, it serves for representing each sample by using hidden
layer output and the analytically determined output weights α. It implies
that the ELM space represents the dictionary space. Note that an interesting
aspect is that in ELM, the number of input nodes and output nodes can be the
dimension D, which would become a transformation problem. If N is set, it
is expression problem focused in this paper. Also, in the proposed structure,
each node is composed of D subnodes (i.e., shadow nodes).</p>
