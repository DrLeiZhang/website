<p><B>Abstract:</B></p>
<p>In the design of machine learning models, one
often assumes the same loss, which, however, may not hold
in cost-sensitive learning scenarios. In a face-recognition-based
access control system, misclassifying a stranger as a house owner
and allowing entry may result in a more serious financial loss
than misclassifying a house owner as a stranger and not allowing
entry. That is, different types of recognition mistakes may lead
to different losses, and therefore should be treated carefully. It is
expected that a cost-sensitive learning mechanism can reduce the
total loss when given a cost matrix that quantifies how severe
one type of mistake is against another one. However, in many
realistic applications, the cost matrix is unknown and unclear
to users. Motivated by these concerns, in this paper, we propose
an evolutionary cost-sensitive discriminative learning (ECSDL)
method, with the following merits: 1) it addresses the definition
of cost matrix in cost-sensitive learning without human intervention;
2) an evolutionary backtracking search algorithm is
derived for the NP-hard cost matrix optimization; and 3) a costsensitive
discriminative subspace is found, where the betweenclass
separability and within-class compactness are well achieved,
such that recognition becomes easier. Experiments in a variety of
cost-sensitive vision and olfaction classification tasks demonstrate
the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed ECSDL approach.</p>
