<h1>[Proj-5: Visual Knowledge Transfer and Adaptation]</a></h1>
<p><B>Paper:</B> </p>
<p>Lei Zhang* and David Zhang, Robust Visual Knowledge Transfer via Extreme Learning Machine-Based Domain Adaptation, IEEE Transactions on Image Processing (<B>T-IP</B>), vol. 25, no. 10, pp. 4959-4973, 2016. <a href="resources/EDA-TIP.pdf">[paper]</a></p>

<p><B>Abstract:</B></p>
<p>We address the problem of visual knowledge adaptation
by leveraging labeled patterns from source domain and a
very limited number of labeled instances in target domain to learn
a robust classifier for visual categorization. This paper proposes
a new extreme learning machine (ELM)-based cross-domain
network learning framework, that is called ELM-based Domain
Adaptation (EDA). It allows us to learn a category transformation
and an ELM classifier with random projection by minimizing the
L2,1-norm of the network output weights and the learning error
simultaneously. The unlabeled target data, as useful knowledge, is
also integrated as a fidelity term to guarantee the stability during
cross-domain learning. It minimizes the matching error between
the learned classifier and a base classifier, such that many existing
classifiers can be readily incorporated as the base classifiers. The
network output weights cannot only be analytically determined,
but also transferrable. In addition, a manifold regularization with
Laplacian graph is incorporated, such that it is beneficial to
semisupervised learning. Extensively, we also propose a model of
multiple views, referred as MvEDA. Experiments on benchmark
visual datasets for video event recognition and object recognition
demonstrate that our EDA methods outperform the existing
cross-domain learning methods.   </p>

<p><B>Approach:</B></p>
<p>The data distribution and decision boundaries. (a) linear classifiers
learned for a three-class problem on labeled data in source domain.
(b) classifiers learned on the source domain do not fit the target domain
due to the change of data distribution. (c) domain adaptation with EDA by
simultaneously learning new classifier and category transformation matrix.
Note that the category transformation denotes the output adaptation with a
matrix Theta.</p>

<p>The flowchart of the proposed cross-domain learning framework in multiple views. Specifically, for each domain, the same type of feature is first
extracted. Second, the base classifier is trained on the raw feature of source data. Third, the feature mapping (random projection) is conducted on the both
features of source and target data. Fourth, the EDA based domain adaptation classifier is learned. Finally, the visual categorization task with domain adaptation
is done.</p>

<p><B>Experiments:</B></p>
<p>we evaluate our proposed methods EDA
and MvEDA on four datasets: 1) the challenging YouTube &
Consumer videos (SIFT and ST features), 2) the 3DA
Office dataset (SURF feature), 3) the 4DA Extended office
dataset (SURF vs. CNN features), 4) the Bing-Caltech dataset
(Classeme feature). Notably, EDA is termed for single feature
scenarios and MvEDA is termed for multiple features based
application scenarios (e.g., YouTube videos).</p>
