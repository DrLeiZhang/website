Dear readers,

The code file is served for the paper "Online Learners' Reading Ability Detection based on Eye-tracking Sensors", by Zehui Zhan, Lei Zhang, Hu Mei, and Patrick S.W. Fong.

In this file, three subfiles are included. 

74m42data.txt: the data file for checking the algorithm (by contacting the authors);

mtl.m: the introduced MTJL algorithm in the paper for exploring the online learners' reading ability in the paper.

demo.m: the main program for readers' test and readers can run this demo.m for some results.

Please contact us if there is any problem.
