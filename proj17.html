<p><B>Abstract:</B></p>
<p>Electronic nose (e-Nose) technology based on metal oxide semiconductor gas sensor array is widely
studied for detection of gas components. This paper proposes a new discriminant analysis framework
(NDA) for dimension reduction and e-Nose recognition. In a NDA, the between-class and the within-class
Laplacian scatter matrix are designed from sample to sample, respectively, to characterize the betweenclass
separability and the within-class compactness by seeking for discriminant matrix to simultaneously
maximize the between-class Laplacian scatter and minimize the within-class Laplacian scatter. In terms
of the linear separability in high dimensional kernel mapping space and the dimension reduction of
principal component analysis (PCA), an effective kernel PCA plus NDA method (KNDA) is proposed for
rapid detection of gas mixture components by an e-Nose. The NDA framework is derived in this paper as
well as the specific implementations of the proposed KNDA method in training and recognition process.
The KNDA is examined on the e-Nose datasets of six kinds of gas components, and compared with state of
the art e-Nose classification methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed KNDA method
shows the best performance with average recognition rate and total recognition rate as 94.14% and 95.06%
which leads to a promising feature extraction and multi-class recognition in e-Nose.</p>
